# HTML Code refactor

This project is a mock-up of an online marketing firm homepage. The page is formatted and styled with basic HTML and CSS. The initial code base for the page contained only generic elements and excessive CSS. Over the course of the project, I refactored the code to make it more readable and accessible both to developers and users of the page.



### Major changes

* Top level div elements were converted to header, main, aside, and foot elements.
* Nested div elements were converted to section elements.
* CSS file was consolidated and restructured to better match semantic layout of the HTML.
* Blank alt attributes were added for all images, as the images do not provide content on this page.



All changes were made on the [workbook branch](https://github.com/Athear/bootcamp_homework_01_Code_refactor/tree/workbook "workbook") and tested to ensure that the existing layout and styling of the website were preserved.
